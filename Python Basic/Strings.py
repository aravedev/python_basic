In python you cant use numbers and strings at the same time, ex:
print(3 + "sheeps") . You will get an error

First, you have to convert the number into string
print("3" + "sheeps"). 

Converting a number into string with str(yourNumber):
number = 4
string_number = str(number)
print(string_number)
"""

number = 4
string_number = str(number)
print(string_number + " cars on the ship")
